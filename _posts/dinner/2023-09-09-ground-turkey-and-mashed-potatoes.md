## Ingredients

MASHED POTATOES
* 6 potatoes, washed and cubed
* 2 Tbsp butter
* &frac14; to &frac12; sour cream
* salt & pepper to taste

Put potatoes and 1 cup of water in the instant pot. Set for 3 minutes with a 10-15 minute natural release. Begin ground turkey mixture.

Once time is up, release remaining pressure and mix in butter, salt/pepper, and sour cream.

GROUND TURKEY MIXTURE
* 1 lb ground turkey
* 1 whole onion, diced
* 2 cloves minced garlic
* 2 Tbsp tomato paste
* 2 Tbsp soy sauce
* &frac12; tsp paprika 
* 1 12 oz bag of frozen peas and carrots
* 1 8oz pack of sliced mushrooms

## Directions

1. Start the mashed potatoes, then begin the ground turkey mixture.
2. Begin by sauteeing ground turkey until browned. Then mix in onion and garlic, mix until garlic is fragrant and onion is soft.
3. Add in tomato paste, soy sauce, paprika, and water/chicken broth (if desired) to thin the sauce.
4. Mix in mushrooms and let them brown in the pan, adding water if needed to keep from burning.
5. Add in frozen peas and carrots last. You can turn off the heat and cover and the frozen vegetables will heat through in about 5 minutes.

Serve ground turkey mixture on top of mashed potatoes.
