Serves 4-6

## Ingredients

* &frac12; pound ground turkey (optional)
* 1 onion, diced (yellow or white)
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 2 cups chicken broth (or water)
* 2 tsp paprika (smoked adds flavor)
* 2 tsp cumin
* &frac12; tsp coriander (optional)
* &frac18; tsp ginger
* 1 tsp sugar (if needed)
* 1 tsp salt (to taste)
* &frac12; tsp pepper (to taste)
* 1 can (14.5oz) red kidney beans (or any bean) rinsed and drained
* 1 cup uncooked brown lentils
* 1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce
* 3 Tbsp tomato paste
* &frac12; cup milk (if wanted)



## Directions

1. Turn instant pot to saute and saute onion and ground turkey (if using), for 5 minutes. Add in garlic powder and saute an additional minute.
2. Pour in broth and deglaze the pot. If you do not scrape it clean you will get a burn error on your instant pot. Mix in all the spices, beans, and lentil. Stir.
3. Dump tomato sauce and paste on top and DO NOT STIR. If it gets to the bottom it will burn and error on the instant pot.
4. Cover and secure the lid. Seal the valve, set instant pot to 10 minutes on high pressure. When done, do a quick release.
5. Stir in salt/pepper and milk if wanting a creamier texture.
6. Serve on top of rice, pasta, or serve like chili.
