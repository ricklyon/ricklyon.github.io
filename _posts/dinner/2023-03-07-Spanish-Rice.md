Spanish rice cooked in 30 minutes using the instant pot. Hearty enough for main dish standalone, in a tortilla as a wrap, or as a side for taco night.

## Ingredients

* drizzle of olive oil
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 7-8 mini peppers, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 cup long-grain rice
* 1 &frac12; chicken broth (or water)
* &frac12; tomato sauce
* 1 tsp. salt
* &frac14; tsp. ground cumin
* 1 15 oz can of pinto beans
* 1 15 oz can of black beans
* 1 cup of frozen corn


## Directions

1. Turn instant pot on to saute and heat oil. Cook onion for 2-3 minutes, then add peppers and cook another 1-2 minutes. Add garlic and rice and cook for 30 seconds, just until lightly browned.
2. Add water and deglaze the pot. Turn instant pot off. Mix in remaining ingredients. Close the lid and set the valve to seal. Cook for 7 minutes on regular pressure, then release naturally for 10-15 minutes.
3. Serve with chips, in a burrito, or as a side dish.

> Serve with chips, sour cream (mixed with taco seaoning for extra flavor), and sliced olives.

> Last time I cooked this recipe, I got a burn warning. Maybe add more water next time? But the rice cooked fine. It came to pressure and then the burn notice happened, so it had enough time to cook.
