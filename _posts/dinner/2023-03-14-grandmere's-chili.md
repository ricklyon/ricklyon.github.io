Serves 4-6, with leftovers.

## Ingredients

* 3 cloves of garlic (or big spoonful of garlic powder)
* 15 oz can tomato sauce
* 10 oz can diced tomatoes
* 1 can corn
* 1 can pinto beans
* 1 can black beans
* 1 can kidney beans
* 1 tsp ground oregano
* 1 Tbsp. cumin
* 2 generous Tbsp. chili powder
* 1 tsp. salt
* &frac14; cup masa flour (or corn meal), optional
* &frac12; lb ground turkey or beef (optional)


## Directions

1. Brown meat (if using) then add garlic and cook a bit more. If not using meat, skip this step.
2. For instant pot or slow cooker, dump all ingredients except masa flour into the pot.
    * INSTANT POT: Set instant pot to soup/chili setting and let release naturally.
    * SLOW COOKER: Place all ingredients in the pot and cook for 4-6 hours on low.
3. If cooking on stove top, saute garlic, then add in spices, tomato sauce, and tomatoes. Reduce heat and simmer for an hour. Then mix in beans and masa flour and cook an additional 20 minutes.
4. Serve with sour cream and cheese.

> * The key to this chili is to cook low and slow.
> * Serve with chips, on baked potatoes, with tortillas, or grilled cheese.
