Easy Instant Pot Meal using chicken and rice

## Ingredients

* 1 Tbsp butter
* frozen, cooked shredded chicken
* 1 small onion
* 2 &frac12; cups chicken broth
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp salt
* &frac34; tsp pepper
* &frac12; milk (warmed)
* 2 cups fresh broccoli (cut into small pieces)
* 2 cups shredded cheese


## Directions

1. Saute onion in butter in the instant pot. Add the spices and cook until onion is soft, about 3-4 minutes. Add in the rice and brown for 1 minute.
2. Add &frac12; cup of the broth and scrape off the browned bits in the bottom of the pan.
3. Pour the rest of the broth over the rice and place the frozen chicken on top. Seal the instant pot and set for 5 minutes on manual high pressure.
4. Let naturally release for 5 minutes. Then release the rest of the pressure and add in the warmed milk and broccoli.
