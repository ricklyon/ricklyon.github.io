Serves 4-6

## Ingredients

* &frac12; cup soy sauce
* 3 &frac12; Tbsp brown sugar
* 3 Tbsp rice vinegar
* 5 cloves garlic, minced
* &frac12; tsp ground ginger
* 1 &frac12; cups water
* 2 broccoli crowns, cut into pieces
* 10 baby carrots, sliced
* 6 oz mushrooms
* 1 block (16 oz) extra firm tofu, pressed and diced
* &frac12; cup sliced green onion
* 1 cup rice, uncooked


## Directions

1. Heat soy sauce, sugar, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, and water on stovetop until just beginning to boil.
2. Place all other ingredients in the pan, mixing in rice last. Pour over soy sauce mixture and toss to coat evenly. Try to get all the rice to go to the bottom. Cover tightly with tin foil.
