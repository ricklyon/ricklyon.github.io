Makes 2 crusts ready in 15 minutes to bake.

## Ingredients

* 2 cups flour (can use 1:1 whole wheat) + more if needed
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 Tablespoon yeast
* 3 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1 cup hot water (microwaved for about 1 minute)


## Directions

1. Mix ingredients together until it holds into a ball. If it is sticky, add &frac14; cup of flour until dough is smooth and stretchy. May still be slightly tacky, but should be workable.
2. Grease or flour the counter. Place the dough on the counter and turn the bowl over the top to let rise while you prep your pizza toppings.
3. Once rolled out and topped, bake on a greased pan at 425&deg;F for around 20minutes.
