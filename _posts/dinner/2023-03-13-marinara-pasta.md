Easy, instant pot meal that comes together in 30 minutes.

## Ingredients

* 1 tsp. olive oil
* one medium yellow onion, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 cups of diced mushrooms
* 1 lb pasta, uncooked
* 3 &frac12; cup water
* 1 15 oz can tomato sauce
* 1 tsp. italian seasoning
* &frac12; tsp salt (or Jane's Krazy Salt)
* &frac14; tsp pepper
* cheese (to serve with)
* sliced olives (to serve with)


## Directions

1. Select the saute setting on the instant pot, pressing until it is on the lowest setting. Once oil is hot, saute onions until translucent. Once almost soft, add mushrooms and garlic and saute another 3 minutes or so.
2. Pour in water and deglaze the pot. Add in pasta and stir. Take the recommended cook time on the package, divide in two, then add one minute to decide how long to cook. When done cooking, let sit for 5 minutes before releasing pressure.
3. While pasta is cooking, mix tomato sauce, italian seasoning, salt and pepper together to make the marinara sauce. Let sit to blend flavors.
4. When pasta is done, mix in marinara sauce, put lid back on to let sauce heat through.
5. Serve with cheese and olives (if desired).
