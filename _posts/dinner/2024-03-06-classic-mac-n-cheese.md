Serves 4-6 with leftovers.

## Ingredients

* 16 oz uncooked elbow macaroni (or any kind of pasta)
* 3 &frac12; cups chicken broth (or water)
* 1 tsp. garlic powder
* &frac12; tsp. pepper
* &frac12; tsp. salt
* 1 cup of frozen mixed vegetables, heated through (about 2 minutes)
* 1-3 cups of cheeses depending on how cheesy you want it
* 1-2 Tbsp of butter


## Directions

1. Add macaroni, chicken broth, garlic powder, pepper, and salt into instant pot.
2. Place lid on instant pot, set valve to sealing. For macaroni, cook for 4 minutes. Natural release for 5 minutes. Then open the valve to release the rest of the pressure. Make sure the instant pot is set to keep warm. 

> * If you release too quickly after cooking pasta, the starch will spray out when releasing pressure. Let it natural release for at least five minutes, if you wait too long (past 20 minutes) the pasta will get soggy.
> * There may be excess water in the pot, stir to see if it mixes in. If not, strain the pasta.

3. Mix in the vegetables, cheeses, and butter. Close the lid and let sit for 5 minutes, letting the residual heat melt the cheese.
4. Serve immediately.

> * If using other pasta, look at the directions on the box. Take the recommended time, divide it in two, and add one minute to determine correct cook time in instant pot.
> * I usually use colby jack, cheddar, and mozzarella as my cheese to mix. Mozzarella results in a very stringy mac & cheese so use sparingly.
> * Can be stored in the fridge for 5 days. When reheating, add a splash of milk to keep it form drying out.
