Homemade egg rolls that can be cooked in an air fryer or in the oven. Meat can be added for a non-vegan option.
Makes 12 egg rolls.

## Ingredients

* 1 small/medium onion, diced
* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* 2 cloves minced garlic
* 10-15 mushrooms, rinsed and diced
* &frac12; package coleslaw
* 1 cup cooked rice
* &frac14; cup (or to taste) soy sauce
* sesame oil (optional)
* 12 egg roll wrapper (store-bought or homemade)
* bowl of water
* spray oil


## Directions

1. Heat olive oil over medium low heat. Add onions and saute until translucent. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds.
2. Add in mushrooms and cook for 2-3minutes. Add in a drizzle of soy sauce.
3. Mix in coleslaw, add lid onto skillet and cook until wilted. Add more soy sauce if needed.
4. Add in rice and stir until heated through.
5. Turn off heat and let mixture cool. If low on time, can skip the cooling step. The hot mixture makes the wrapper more pliable and it will tear easily.
6. Prep an egg roll wrapper by placing it diagonally to make a kite shape. Dip your finger in the bowl of water and wet the top corner of the egg roll. Take 2-3 Tbsp of the mixture and place it in a line halfway between the bottom corner and the two side corners. Pull the bottom corner over the mixture and tuck the two side corners in, rolling up as you go. The water should seal the egg roll wrapper.
7. Place finished rolls in the air fryer basket, giving &frac12; to 1 inch of space between rolls. Spray lightly with oil and cook at 380&deg;F for 10 minutes, flipping the rolls over halfway through.
8. Let cool for a few minutes before serving, as inside will be hot.
