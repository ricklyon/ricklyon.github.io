Classic waffles from Better Homes and Gardens Cook Book, with a few additions.

Makes 16 4-inch waffles

## Ingredients

* 1 &frac34; cup flour
* 1 Tbsp. sugar
* 1 Tbsp. baking powder
* &frac14; tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 2 eggs
* 1 &frac34; cup milk
* &frac12; cup vegetable oil
* 1 tsp. vanilla


## Directions

1. Mix together dry ingredients in a large bowl.
2. Mix wet ingredients in a large measuring cup (or bowl).
3. Pour wet ingredients into the dry and mix until just combined. There will be lumps. Let the batter rest.
4. While the batter rests, preheat the waffle iron. Spray lightly with oil if not already a well-seasoned iron.
5. When iron is hot, add &frac14; cup of batter to each section of the iron. Close lid and cook for 4-6 minutes. 4 minutes for soft waffles, 6 for crispy waffles.
6. When done, remove from iron with a fork and cool on a wire rack. Serve immediately or cool and freeze for later use.


> To reheat frozen waffles, toast in toaster for 2 minutes. Watch closely as they can burn easily.
