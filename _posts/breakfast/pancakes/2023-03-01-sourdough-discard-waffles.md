Makes 16 waffles

## Ingredients

* 2 cups sourdough starter or discard
* 1 cup milk
* 4 Tbsp melted butter
* 2 Tbsp sugar
* 2 eggs
* 3 cups flour
* 3 tsps baking powder
* 1 tsp salt 


## Directions

1. In a large bowl, mix sourdough discard, milk, sugar, eggs, and melted butter. Mix well.
2. Add in dry ingredients and mix. Batter will be thicker than normal batter. More like a cookie dough.
3. Spoon batter into waffle maker, each &frac14; of the iron should get roughly &frac14; to &frac12; cup of batter.
4. Cook until steam slows from waffle iron. Approximately 5 minutes.

### Notes for next time:
* Try to make a thinner batter? Add more milk? Waffles are dense.
