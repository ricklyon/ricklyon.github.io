Makes 14 small pancakes (4 inch)

## Ingredients
* 1 cup flour
* 1/4 cup oats
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1 cup milk
* 1 egg
* 2 large bananas (ripe is better)
* 2.5 tsp baking powder

## Directions

1. Peel and mash bananas and mix with baking powder. Add in milk and egg and stir.
2. Add salt and oats and stir. Add flour and stir until combined.
3. Cook as directed in waffle iron. Spray iron generously since these have  tendency to stick more than regular waffes.
