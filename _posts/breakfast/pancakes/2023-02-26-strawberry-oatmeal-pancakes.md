Makes 14 small pancakes (4 inch)

## Ingredients
* 1 cup old fashioned oats
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 2 eggs
* 4 tbsp. canola oil
* 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
* 2 1/2 tbsp. sugar
* 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* 1 cup finely chopped fresh strawberries

## Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the oatmeal and the buttermilk and let sit for 20 minutes. 
2. After the 20 minutes, add the eggs, vanilla and oil and mix well.
3. Add the fours, sugar, powder, soda, salt and cinnamon and mix together.
4. Gently mix in the fresh strawberries.
5. Heat your griddle to 350 degrees.
6. Drop the thick batter ( about 3/4 cup size) onto the griddle, kind of spread into a circle shape and cook for 3 minutes, flip and then cook for 2 or 3 more minutes or until batter is not raw.
7. I find the on my non-stick griddle, not greasing it works best to not burn the pancakes. I do however spray my spatual with nonsitck cooking spray for easy flipping.
