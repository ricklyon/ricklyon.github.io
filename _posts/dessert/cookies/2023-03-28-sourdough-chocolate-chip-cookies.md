Makes 3 dozen cookies.

## Ingredients

* &frac14; cup butter
* 1 cup sourdough starter
* &frac12; cup sugar
* &frac12; cup light brown sugar, packed
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs
* 2 &frac12; cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* splash of milk (about 1 tsp.), dairy or non-dairy, optional
* 2 cups semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F.
2. In a medium microwave safe bowl, melt the butter, about 30seconds. Does not need to be completely melted. Mix in sourdough starter until mixed smooth.
3. Cream in the butter and sugars until smooth and light colored. Should look less grainy.
4. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Whip for a few seconds to make the mixture lighter colored and frothy.
5. Add in baking soda, salt, and flour. Mix well. If flour isn't mixing in, add the splash of milk to slacken the dough.
6. Fold in the chocolate chips, just until mixed.
7. Using two spoons, scoop 1 Tbsp of dough out of the bowl with the first spoon, then scrape it off onto an ungreased baking sheet with the other spoon. You should be able to fit a dozen cookies on one pan.
8. Bake at 375&deg;F for 6-8 minutes, until tops are lightly browned. Cool on pan for a few minutes and then move to a wire rack to continue cooling.


> * Store immediately to maintain softness, best eaten within 5 days.
> * Dough can be frozen into balls or a log to be sliced and baked directly from frozen.
