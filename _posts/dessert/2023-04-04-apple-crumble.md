Makes 9 servings, in a 7x11 or 9x9 pan

## Ingredients

FILLING:
* 3 apples, cored and thinly sliced (I used Envy apples)
* 2 Tbsp flour
* 1 tsp cinnamon

CRUMBLE:
* 4 Tbsp butter
* &frac14; cup brown sugar
* 2 Tbsp flour
* 1 cup rolled oats

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Grease a 7x11 or 9x9 pan.
2. Toss the apples in flour and cinnamon to coat generously. This will make the sauce for the filling as the apples cook. Pour into pan.
3. Make the crumble by mixing all ingredients together, rubbing the butter in until only pea sized amounts are left. Pour over top of apples.
4. Bake uncovered for 30-40 minutes, or until top is lightly browned and apples are cooked through.
