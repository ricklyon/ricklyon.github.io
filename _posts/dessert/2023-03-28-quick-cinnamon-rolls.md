Makes 9 cinnamon rolls

## Ingredients

DOUGH:
* 1 cup flour
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp baking powder
* &frac12; tsp salt
* 1 &frac12; tsp butter, melted
* &frac38; cup milk
* &frac12; egg

FILLING:
* 1 Tbsp butter
* &frac14; cup brown sugar
* &frac12; tsp cinnamon


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400&deg;F. Grease a round cake dish with butter or oil.
2. Whisk dry ingredients together. Rub in butter with hands.
3. Beat milk and egg together. Pour into flour and mix. Once soft dough forms, dump out on floured surface and roll into a rectange &frac14; inch thick. Brush with 1 Tbsp butter.
4. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together to create filling, then press into rectangle. Roll up into log.
5. Using floss, cut the log into thirds, then cut each third into thirds again, creating 9 rolls. Place in greased dish, one or two in the middle and the rest around the edge of the pan.
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes until rolls sound hollow when tapped and tops are golden brown.



> Can fill with orange sugar and cardamom instead (about &frac14; cup orange sugar and &frac14; tsp cardamom).
