## Ingredients

* 1 russet potato, rinsed and dried
* spray oil of any kind
* Jane's Krazy Salt (to taste)


## Directions

1. Slice the potato into thin matchsticks.
2. Spray the basket of the air fryer. Put potatoes into the basket. Spray tops, season with salt (or however you'd like to season) and shake the basket.
3. Cook at 375&deg;F. Shake the basket halfway. At the 10 minute mark, check for doneness. Cook closer to 15 minutes for crispy fries, and 10-12 minutes for softer fries.
4. Let cool as fries will be hot, but best served immediately. Can be reheated in air fryer for a few minutes if needed.
