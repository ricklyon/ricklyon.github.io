Hummus pairs well with any vegetable. Dip pretzels or crackers in it. Also can be used as a spread.
Makes 2 cups of hummus.

## Ingredients

* &frac14; cup lemon juice (fresh or bottled is fine)
* &frac14; cup creamy peanut butter (can use tahini as well)
* 1 small garlic clove, minced
* 2 Tbsp. olive oil
* &frac12; tsp. ground cumin
* &frac12; tsp salt
* 1 15 oz can of garbanzo beans/chickpeas
* 2-3 Tbsp. water
* ground paprika and chili powder for serving


## Directions

1. In a blender (or food processor), whip peanut butter and lemon juice until fluffy. Scrape down sides as needed. This is what gives the hummus its creaminess.
2. Add the oil. garlic, cumin, and salt. Whip until throughly incorporated, scraping sides as needed.
3. Open, drain, and rinse the chickpeas. Add half the chickpeas and 1 Tbsp of water into and blend. Once smooth, add rest of chickpeas and more water (if needed). Adjust for thickness you'd like.
4. Garnish with paprika and chili powder. Can add a drizzle of olive oil as well.


> Hummus needs to be stored in refrigerator to maintain freshness.
