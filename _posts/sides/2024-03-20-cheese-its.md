Makes 50+ cheese its

## Ingredients

* 8 ounces of extra sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
* 4 Tablespoons salted butter
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup flour
* 2 Tablespoons cold water


## Directions

1. Mix cheese, butter, and salt together until well mixed and no clumps of butter remain. Mix in by hand if needed.
2. Add in flour and rub in until well combined. Add in water 1 Tbsp at a time until soft dough is achieved. It is okay if flecks of cheese are still visible.
3. Press into a disc and wrap tighly in plastic wrap. Let chill in fridge for at least an hour.
4. Preheat oven to 375&deg;F
5. Divide dough into two pieces. Roll one piece into a large rectangle, rolling as thin as possible. Using a pizza cutter, cut strips lengthwise and then cut up and down to make squares. Using the tip of a chopstick make small holes in the middle of each square.
6. Place squares close together on parchment lined baking sheet. Bake for around 15 minutes. Less if using the convection fan in the oven.
7. When done, let cool immediately on a wire rack. Leaving them on the baking sheet will make them become soggy.
