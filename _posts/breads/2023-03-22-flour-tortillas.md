Makes 12-16 tortillas (depending on size)

## Ingredients

* 3 cups flour
* &frac34; tsp salt
* 1 cup water
* &frac14; cup oil


## Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Stir in water and oil.
2. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead 10-12 times, adding flour or water if needed to achieve a smooth dough. Let rest 10 minutes.
3. Pull out chunks of dough about 2 inches in diameter. Using a tortilla press, press as thinly as possible.
4. Cook tortillas over medium heat, flipping when bubbles appear or when lightly browned.
5. Serve immediately or keep cooked tortillas warm by wrapping with a clean dish towel.


> Cook with higher heat? Try to roll dough thinner too?
