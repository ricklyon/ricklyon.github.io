Makes 2 loaves

## Ingredients

* 1 1/4 cups water (10 ounces)
* 1 1/2 tsp. yeast
* 2 cups ripe sourdough starter (16 ounces)
* 4 to 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tbsp. kosher salt

## Directions

1. Combine water and yeast, let dissolve. Stir in sourdough starter until mostly dissolved (a few stringy bits are ok).
2. Add 4 cups and the salt, and stir to make a shaggy dough. Knead the dough for 8 minutes. Add flour 1 tbsp. at a time. The dough is ready when it comes together into a smooth ball that is slightly tackly the touch and holds a ball shape in your hand.
3. Let dough rise until doubled in size in an oiled bowl for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
4. Turn dough out and divide in two. Shape into rough balls and let rest 20 minutes.
5. Shape into loaves, transfer into oiled pans and let rise until they're starting to puff over the rim, 1 to 1 1/2 hours (can leave in fridge to rise overnight).
6. Preheat oven to 450F. Slash the tops with a serrated knife, immediately place in oven. For crispier crust, spritz inside of oven with water before closing.
7. Bake for 10 minutes, the turn heat down to 400F. Continue baking for 25 to 30 minutes until the loaves are a deep golden brown and the loaves sound hollow when tapped, 
8. Let cool completely on a wire rack, tip out pans to cool.
