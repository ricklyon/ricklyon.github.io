Makes 8 bowls.

## Ingredients

* 3 cups warm water
* 1 1/2 Tablespoon yeast
* 2 Tablespoons + 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* 1 Tablespoon salt
* 4 Tablespoons butter, melted
* 7 to 9 cups flour
* 1 Tablespoon milk (or egg wash)


## Directions

1. Combine the water, yeast, and ½ teaspoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Let stand until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, add the salt, remaining sugar, butter, yeast mixture, and 3 ½ cups of the flour, and mix.  Slowly keep adding more flour (about 1 cup at a time) until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl.
3. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. The dough shouldn't be "sticky", but may barely stick to your finger. Knead for 2-3 more minutes adding flour to keep dough from sticking as you need. (Note: I used about 8 cups of flour.)
4. Grease the bowl and transfer dough to the blow, flipping over once to coat the top of the dough. Cover and let rise for 30 minutes (or until doubled)
5. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces Tuck the dough pieces into balls, pulling the top tight as you tuck in from the bottom (like how you form dinner rolls) Place the dough ball on a greased baking sheet. I fit about 4 per baking sheet. Make a very small "X" slit on the top of the dough rounds with a serrated knife.
6. Cover the rolls really lightly with a piece of plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled, about 30-40 more minutes.
7. Pre-heat the oven to 400F (using convection fan) and wash tops of rolls with milk.
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes, swapping bottom pan for the top pan after 15 minutes.
9. Cool on wire rack, not cutting into them for at least 15 minutes after baking.
