Makes one dozen rolls.

## Ingredients

* 1 &frac12; cup warm water
* 1 cup fed sourdough starter
* 1 Tbsp yeast
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 2 Tbsp oil
* 2 tsps salt
* 4 cups flour


## Directions

1. Combine water and sourdough starter. Add in yeast and allow to bloom. Mix in sugar and oil as well.
2. Begin mixing in salt and flour, mixing until the dough has pulled away from the sides. Once it forms a ball, tip out onto a floured surface.
3. Knead for 5-10 minutes until dough is elastic. When you pull a piece off, it can be sticky but should roll easily into a ball without sticking all over your hands.
4. Spray the bowl, put the dough in, turning over once to grease all sides and let rise for 1 hour or so until doubled.
5. After dough has risen, punch down dough and make a long snake shape. Divide the dough in half. Divide each half into thirds. Then divide those thirds into halves again. Taking each piece, pull into a roll shape by pulling the top to the bottom to make a firm ball shape.
6. Place into a greased 13x9 pan (glass or metal). 12 rolls should fit in each pan. Let them rise again until doubled, an hour or so.
7. Preheat oven to 400&deg; F.
8. Once risen, bake for 15-17 minutes, until tops are lightly browned and when tapped make a hollow sound.
9. Immediately when taken from the oven, spread butter on tops so it will melt.
10. Let cool in the pan, serve immediately or store in an air-tight bag or container for up to 5 days.
