Makes 16 naan

## Ingredients

* 1 cup sourdough starter discard (unfed and stirred)
* 5 cups flour
* 1 cup whole milk
* &frac12; cup full fat plain yogurt
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 3 tsp salt


## Directions

1. Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl. Dough is stiff, stir with hands and knead if hard to mix in with spoon. Grease bowl, then place dough into bowl and let rise until doubled. In bread proofing drawer/oven, this will take 6 hours or so. Colder areas will take longer. Cover with plastic wrap to keep dough from drying out.
2. When risen, turn out onto counter. Cut in half and set aside &frac12; of the dough. Cut the remaining half in half, then each piece in half again, and in half once more to make eight "pizza slices". Shape each slice into a ball and set aside. Repeat with the other half of the dough.
3. Once 16 balls are formed, pre-heat the griddle to 350&deg;F.
4. Using a tortilla press, place a dough ball onto the press (use a cut ziploc bag to prevent sticking to press) and press dough until it is about &frac18; inch thick.
5. Once flattened, place dough onto griddle. Cook for 2-3 minutes on this side. Flip over to other side and cook an additional 1-2 minutes. Flip again to beginning side and cook for 1-2 minutes. The naan should puff up at this point (it may not though).
6. Serve immediately or store in an air-tight container for up to three days.



> Maybe consider warming milk to speed rise time?
