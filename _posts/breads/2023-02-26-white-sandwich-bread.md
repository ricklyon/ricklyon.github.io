Makes one loaf.

## Ingredients

* 3 1/4 cup flour (sift and level when measuring)   
        add more as needed (210 + 210 - 250g or more)
* 1 1/4 tsp. salt (8g)
* 2 1/4 tsp. yeast (one packet) (5g)
* 2 tbsp. sugar (28g)
* 1 3/8 cup warm water (325mL)
* 2 tbsp. oil

## Directions

1. Combine 1 1/2 cup of the flour, salt, yeast and sugar. Add the water and oil and mix until combined. Mixture will be thinner than bread dough. Cover the bowl and let batter rest 10 minutes. It will be slightly bubbly near the end.
2. Add the rest of the flour (and more if needed) until dough forms a ball that clears the bottom and sides of the bowl. Dough should be slightly tacky, and may leave residue on fingers. 
3. Knead 2 minutes until dough is smooth.
4. Lightly grease a large bowl. Let dough rise until doubled (1 hour at least).
5. Cover with greased plastic wrap or kitchen towel before rising.
6. Punch down dough and press into a 8in long rectangle. Roll up and seal semas on the edges and sides. Place dough in prepared loaf pan, cover and let rise until dough is past the rim of the pan by 1 inch (1 hour at least).
7. Bake bread at 350F for 30-32 minutes. covering the bread with foil if the top is getting too dark.
8. Turn out bread immediately to cool.


> For wheat bread: Use 1 &frac12; cups of whole wheat in step one instead of white flour. Use white flour for step 2.
