A spiced up version of rice krispies, tasting like s'mores.
Makes on 13x9 pan

## Ingredients

* &frac14; cups butter
* 13 ounces of large marshmallows
* &frac14; cup of semi-sweet mini chocolate chips 
* 4 cups of cocoa pebbles


## Directions

1. Put butter in a microwave safe bowl and melt. Mix in marshmallows and microwave in 30 second bursts, stir after each time, until a smooth mixture forms.
2. Pour in cocoa pebbles and stir until mixed well and evenly coated.
3. Spray a 13x9 pan with oil. Pour the mixture into the pan and press into an even layer. Sprinkle leftover cocoa pebbles and semi-sweet chocolate chips on top.
4. Cool and serve.

> Very gooey with this recipe, maybe add less marshmallows.
