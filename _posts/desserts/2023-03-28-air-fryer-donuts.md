Makes 12+ glazed donuts

## Ingredients

* 1 cup whole milk, lukewarm (about 100 degrees)
* 2 &frac12; tsp yeast
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 large egg
* &frac14; cup butter, melted
* 3 cups flour

FOR THE GLAZE:
* 2 cups powdered sugar
* 2-3 Tbsp milk
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 tsp food coloring (optional)
* &frac14; cup sprinkles (optional)


## Directions

1. Stir together milk, yeast, and sugar. Allow to sit until yeast is foamy.
2. Add salt, egg, melted butter, and 2 cups of flouer to the milk mixture. Stir until flour is moistened. Add the last cup of flour, kneading in if needed. Dough should be smooth and elastic.
3. Grease a bowl, place the dough in the bowl (turning once to coat the whole ball). Let dough rest until doubled. When you press the dough with your finger it should leave an indentation.
4. Turn dough out onto floured surface and roll it to &frac12; inch thickness. Using a 3 inch round circular cutter, cut out the outside edge of the donut. Take a one inch circle and cut out the donut holes from the center.
5. Once cut, make sure counter is greased/floured so they won't stick, then allow to rest for 20-30 minutes until puffy.
6. Spray basket of air fryer, then place donuts in basket one inch apart. Spray tops with oil and cook at 350&deg;F until golden, about 4-5 minutes. Turn donuts halfway through or bottom of the donut will get soggy.
7. While donuts are cooking, mix together powdered sugar and 1 Tbsp of milk. Add vanilla and food coloring now. Then add milk slowly until desired consistency is reached. If you want a thick frosting, use less milk. If you want a glaze, use more milk. Pour into a bowl large enough to dip donuts in.
8. When donuts are cooked, dip them in the frosting while still hot. Let drip on a wire rack. Glaze will set in about 10 minutes.
