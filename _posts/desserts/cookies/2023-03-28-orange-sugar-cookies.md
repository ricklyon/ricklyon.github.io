Makes three dozen cookies.

## Ingredients

LEMON SUGAR:
* &frac13; cup sugar
* 2-3 teaspoons fresh orange zest (from one orange)

COOKIES:
* &frac12; cup butter (softened)
* &frac34; cup sugar
* 1 Tbsp fresh orange zest ( from one orange)
* 1 large egg
* &frac14; cup fresh orange juice (squeeze two oranges)
* &frac12; tsp vanilla
* 2 &frac34; flour
* &frac12; baking soda
* &frac12; baking powder
* &frac12; tsp salt


## Directions

1. For the orange sugar, combine the sugar and zest in a bowl and rub zest into sugar with fingers until fragrant. Set aside.
2. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Lightly grease a baking sheet.
3. Cream butter, sugar, and orange zest together until light and fluffy.
4. Add the egg, orange juice, and vanilla. Mix again well. The mixture will curdle, don't worry.
5. Add the dry ingredients and mix until combined.
6. Taking lumps of dough about 1 &frac12; - 2 Tbsp size, form balls and then roll them in the orange sugar until coated. Place on baking sheet. Repeat until pan is filled with a dozen cookies.
7. Bake for 8-10 minutes, until top is cracked. Let cool on tray and then move to cooling rack to finish cooling.




> I added 2 Tbsp of flour extra and the cookies weren't as flat as I'd like. Also may have used 1 &frac12; cup sugar instead of &frac34; I can't remember.
