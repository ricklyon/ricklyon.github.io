Makes: 4 dozen cookies

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup butter
* 1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 2 1/2 cup flour
* splash of almond milk
* semi-sweet chocolate chips (about 2 cups)

## Directions

1. Melt butter in microwave, stir in peanut butter to melt in residual heat.
2. Cream in sugars, until mixture looks less grainy.
3. Beat in eggs and vanilla, until mixture looks airy and paler in color.
4. Add all dry ingredients and mix. If mixture is too tight and dry, add a splash of milk to help release the dough. (Note: I added about 2 tsp last time).
5. Mix in chocolate chips.
6. Pre-heat oven to 375 F, no fan. Using 1 1/2 tbsp cookie scoop, make scoops about 3/4 full, a dozen to a baking sheet.
7. Bake for 8 minutes, until tops look less wet and are lightly browned. Cool on wire rack.



## Suggestions for next time:
* see if crunchy vs creamy makes a difference
* try cow milk, or maybe omit?
