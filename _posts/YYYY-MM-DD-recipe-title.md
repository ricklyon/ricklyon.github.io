## Ingredients

* 2 &frac12; cups something, warmed to 100&deg;F
* Not all fractions work like above, so use this instead for something like 5/9: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> 


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.
2. Drop tablespoon-sized clumps onto un-greased cookie sheets. Bake for 8-12 minutes, or until pale brown. Allow to cool on the pan for a minute or three, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling.
