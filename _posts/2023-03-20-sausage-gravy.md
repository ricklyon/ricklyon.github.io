Makes 3-4 cups of gravy for biscuits.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb of pork sausage
* &frac14; tsp pepper
* &frac14; cup flour
* 3-4 cups milk, divided



## Directions

1. Brown the sausage over a low heat. Only a few bits should be crispy and brown. Drain excess fat, but leave a reasonable amount to make the gravy.
2. Add in flour and stir. Cook for 1-2 minutes to get rid of floury taste.
3. Stir in 1 cup of milk and let thicken. Mix in pepper (to taste).
4. Continue stirring in 1 cup at a time, until desired thickness is reached. Gravy will thicken as cooled. Serve immediately.
